@user @user Nothing to do with me.  It's not my choice, nor is it yours, to dictate what another woman chooses. #feminism
@user No. It's absurd to refer to healthcare that saves pregnant people's lives as "killing.

@user defunding PP won't mean fewer abortions. It will mean more dead women.
@user I don't either. Why would you want to make people have kids? Esp when they're not prepared? Makes no sense.

Kudos to the mentality that believes people who are dumb enough to not use protection are 'mature enough' to take care of a baby.

I don't plan on ever having an abortion, but here's the thing ...I don't think anyone ever PLANS on it.
If it's getting old maybe you should stop calling embryos & fetuses babies.

pro-life? no you're more pro-birth then after that the baby can support itself!!! #makesnosense #prowomen
@user @user @user you know what massively reduces abortion? Sex education and access to birth control.
She*  knows what's best for her* happiness & her* body
@user putting abortion in with choices for women just won my heart over. Yaaaaaas! #shahs
Bodily autonomy is a human right. A person's access to abortion is a human right. #reprojustice #reprorights
RT @user The single most important factor for women's advancement in society is our ability to control our fertility.
They know what's best for their health They know what's best for their happiness They know what's best for their well being..
Some people are not ready for a child or they were even raped, and theres already too many kids who need adopting anyway
Do you know anything about the right of bodily autonomy? Describe it then if you don't think the fetus takes it away from her
#SoProLife they want to force Texans to carry pregnancies that WON'T EVEN PRODUCE LIFE.
@user @user Thank goodness politicians saw sense and recognised women's rights over their own bodies.
I'm killing my baby tonight, I don't care if it's wrong or right!

It's so brilliant that #lovewins - now extend the equality to women's rights #abortionrights
ALSO what the fuck gives a man the right to tell a woman what to do with her body? If she wants to get an abortion so be it Texas.
@user Not so great for the women you want to force to give birth against their wills. #rapeculture
We live in a world where people care more about religious rights than consent & reproductive rights....
People who have been pregnant can be pro choice. People who can't have kids can be pro choice. People who have a uterus can be
It's a free country. Freedom includes freedom of choice.
I can't stand people who are pro life because they had a stillborn or loss....
@user Keeping pregnant people safe is a great reason for abortion, though.
People who have never had an abortion can be prochoice. People with a uterus can be prochoice. People who never want kids can be
@user No, I can't explain why you would consider a medical procedure that leaves the patient healthy & happy as killing.
@user You would force a woman to risk her health, sanity, and life, to continue a doomed pregnancy. Against her will. No.
Lol it's no ones choice but the woman's when it comes to abortion. Men shouldn't even be able to vote on the issue.
Lmao my school thinks giving women the right to an abortion is against feminism. They don't know feminism #wtf
@user No one is advocating "punishment". Would you force ppl to give birth against their wills? #rapeculture

Oh look!!! So not only are antichoice strongly against pregnant people's human rights, they're also homophobic. Shocker. (Not)
@user I don't think I have a right to use someone else's body without consent. Do you? #rapeculture
People aren't 'pro-life' they're 'pro-birth'. When a mother can't provide what happens then?
@user @user @user @user @user who is for it. I'm not. But am for a women's right to her own body.
Anti choice laws are sexist because they only effect women*.
So anti-choice laws are telling these women they're incapable and shouldn't make decisions that involve their own body.
Not all women want to have or bear children, and that is okay
I would never expect an 11 year old girl to have to carry a pregnancy to term

Women ARE capable of making decisions
Oh you dont like that Im Pro-choice.  Pftt. Dont try to force me to be pro-life. Fuck off   #sorrynotsorry
#antichoice NEVER try to police men over sex, but punishing women puts  them into a frenzy.
Anti choice laws only effect women.  People don't care about things that don't effect men
People with a uterus can be pro choice. People who have been pregnant can be pro choice. People who lost a child can be prochoice
You can't give the "death penalty" to something not living sentient or autonomous #WarOnWomen #roe42 #reprohealth
@user if they made it illegal, people would use coat hangers, and your photos would really be messed up. #letdoctorsdoit
Yea, let's make a woman suffer 18 years and raise a child with an unfit parent who hates it because of "morality".
Pro-life laws only effect women so anti choicers are fine with these laws because the laws are only hurting are females
Anti-choice laws are entirely men controlling women
A fetus is not living, breathing, born, sentient, or autonomous which is why the pregnant woman's choice matters more
What about in cases of rape
Only one can have bodily autonomy
Antis don't care because the only people the laws are hurting are females and they don't care about things that don't effect men
Like 96% of antis don't care about breathing viable persons, and 100% care about embryos more
Anti choice laws are sexist because they ignore the fact that men abandon their pregnant partners & those men face no punishment
This is the same reason it's sexist that we don't cover women's birth control. Any issue that primarily effects women is ignored
@user YOU CAN'T HANDLE THE TRUTH! People will always do it no matter the laws. #letdoctorsdoit
Not your uterus, not your choice--from conception on, it really is THAT simple! #fem2gen #YesAllWomen

Whether someone wants to have children or not should be completely up to the person carrying that pregnancy...
